Here is the updated Privacy Policy for your **Movies Database** app. I have removed all references to location/geolocation and weather APIs, and replaced the third-party section with relevant terminology for a movie app (e.g., Movie Data APIs).

***

# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the **Movies Database** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by **Anupam khosla** (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

---

## Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed to protect your privacy. **The Service Provider does not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from your device.**

### 1. Device and Usage Information (Automatically Collected)

The Application collects basic usage information when you download and use it. This information may include non-personally identifiable data such as:

* Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)
* The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
* The time spent on the Application
* The operating system you use on your mobile device

### 2. Location Data

The Application **does not** collect, store, access, or transmit information about your precise or approximate location. The Application does not use Location Services.

---

## Third Party Access

The Application uses external services to function:

1.  **Movie Data API:** The Application transmits search queries (such as movie titles or actor names) directly to external movie database providers (e.g., TMDB, OMDB) to fetch content. These queries do not contain personally identifiable information. Please refer to those providers' privacy policies for their data handling practices.
2.  **Analytics/Crash Reporting (If Applicable):** Aggregated, anonymized log data and usage data (as described above) is periodically transmitted to external services (such as crash reporters) to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

* as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
* when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
* with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider does not collect or retain any personally identifiable data. Usage and Log Data collected by third-party services are retained for a reasonable time for the purpose of application improvement and debugging.

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (anupamkhosla1993@gmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the non-personal information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-12-11

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
